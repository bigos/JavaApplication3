* Example of Clojure, Java and deps.edn struggle

  Have you tried to have Clojure and java inter-operation? Did you find that the
  examples are not suitable for the noobs? You are not alone!

  This project is supposed to be an example of simple Netbeans project with some
  Clojure inter-operation that is supposed to help in search of better solution.

  With great help from https://github.com/seancorfield   I have managed to
  modify another app to use Clojure correctly. That can be used a example of an
  important step leading to refactoring of legacy Ant based java application.
